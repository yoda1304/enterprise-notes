Resources Used:

The main resource I'm using on this is my final project for a previous class,
which was a hypothetical inventory/personel management system for an ice cream
parlor. It had content hosting and submission (though not in this social sense),
as well as authentication/authorization a basic search function. I'm pulling a
lot of stuff from that, but it's not a 1 to 1 match where I can copy paste every-
thing, mostly just the structural stuff thats similar across anything you throw
together in rails. The database structure is fully original though, same with 
anything badge related or immediate immersion.
