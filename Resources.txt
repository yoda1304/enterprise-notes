Resources Used:

The main resource I'm using on this is the content & my final project for a previous class,
which was a hypothetical inventory/personel management system for an ice cream
parlor. It had content hosting and submission (though not in this social sense),
as well as authentication/authorization and a basic search function. I'm pulling 
a lot of stuff from that, but it's not a 1 to 1 match where I can copy paste 
everything, mostly just the structural stuff thats similar across anything you 
throw together in rails. The database structure is fully original though, same 
with anything badge related or immediate immersion.
